// Interfaces in Java

/*
An Interface in Java programming language is defined as an abstract type used to specify the behavior of a class.
An interface in Java is a blueprint of a behaviour. A Java interface contains static constants and abstract methods.

The interface in Java is a mechanism to achieve abstraction. There can be only abstract methods in the Java interface,
not the method body. It is used to achieve abstraction and multiple inheritance in Java. In other words, you can say t
hat interfaces can have abstract methods and variables. It cannot have a method body. Java Interface also represents the
IS-A relationship.

When we decide a type of entity by its behaviour and not via attribute we should define it as an interface.

Like a class, an interface can have methods and variables, but the methods declared in an interface are by default
abstract (only method signature, no body).

/*
In Java we use different different keyword for different purposes
extends -> for Inheritance
abstract -> for abstract methods and class
interface -> for creating interface(where all methods are abstract)
implements -> for implementing Interfaces

/*
Abstract Vs Interface
We can't extend multiple abstract classes but we can implement multiple
interfaces at a time.
